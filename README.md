## About
Day Vibe is an entertainment web application targeted toward teens and young adults in Nashville. Users may submit a journal entry, which is stored (by Firebase) and displayed in real time with a time stamp (using jQuery and Moment.js). From the user's input, the emotion is determined (by Parallel Dots API). Once the emotion has been determined, Day Vibe displays a Spotify playlist that is specific to that emotion. In addition, this application will suggest a nearby restaurant (with Zomato API), in case the user would like to order food or visit a local restaurant that day. By giving users a place to express themselves, listen to music, and discover local restaurants, Day Vibe is a great mood lifter for today's young population.
